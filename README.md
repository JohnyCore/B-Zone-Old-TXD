## Description
The **Classic Textdraw Mod** is a simple yet effective solution designed to enhance the visual experience for players on **RPG.B-ZONE.RO**. Due to a recent server update, textdraws now display unattractive outlines, disrupting the immersive in-game interface. This mod addresses the issue by removing the ugly outlines and restoring a more classic, clean textdraw style, improving both aesthetics and readability.

## Features
- The mod automatically removes the unsightly outlines from specific textdraws upon joining the server.
- In case of connection delays or other issues, the `/ctxd` command allows manual application of the fix at any time.
- Textdraws for player names and the server message are cleaned up with outline and shadow adjustments for a more polished look.
- Runs efficiently in the background without interfering with other gameplay mechanics.

## Why Use This Mod?
After the latest update on **RPG.B-ZONE.RO**, players have noticed that the textdraws are now surrounded by unattractive outlines, negatively impacting the overall UI experience. This mod corrects the visual clutter, giving the textdraws a classic appearance once again, without affecting gameplay.

## Installation
1. Download and install [MoonLoader](https://blast.hk/threads/13305/).
2. Place the Lua script file into the `moonloader` folder within your GTA SA directory.
3. Place the `.lua` file in your MoonLoader `scripts` folder.
4. Start your game, and the script will load automatically.
5. Join the server, and the mod will automatically apply the fix. If needed, you can use the `/ctxd` command to manually reapply it.

## Usage
- The fix will automatically trigger when you connect to the server.
- If you're experiencing connection lag or the fix doesn't apply immediately, simply type `/ctxd` in the chat to manually execute the command.

## Notes
- This mod is tailored specifically for **RPG.B-ZONE.RO** and may not function as intended on other servers.
- Adjust the `wait()` time inside the script if needed, depending on connection speed.
